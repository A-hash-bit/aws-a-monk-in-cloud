SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely log into a remote computer and execute commands on that computer over an unsecured network. SSH provides strong authentication and encryption for secure data transmission over an insecure network.

Here's how SSH works:

1. Initial Connection: The client (such as a user's local computer) initiates a connection to the server (such as a remote server). The client and server negotiate the encryption algorithm and key to use for the session.

2. Authentication: The server sends the client its host key, which the client uses to verify the identity of the server. The client can also provide a password or a private key for authentication, depending on the server's configuration.

3. Key Exchange: The client and server establish a shared secret key using public key cryptography. This key is used to encrypt all subsequent communications between the client and server.

4. Encryption: The client and server use the shared secret key to encrypt their communications, ensuring that any data transmitted over the network is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

5. Data Transfer: The client can now securely execute commands on the server and exchange data with the server over the encrypted connection.

6. Session Close: When the session is complete, the client and server close the SSH connection.

SSH is widely used to remotely access and manage servers, perform administrative tasks, transfer files, and perform other tasks that require secure access to a remote computer over an unsecured network. SSH provides a secure and encrypted alternative to traditional remote access protocols, such as Telnet, that transmit data in clear text, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
