# Run Flask App on AWS EC2 Instance

Install Python Virtualenv
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
Activate the new virtual environment in a new directory

Create directory
```bash
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
```
Create the virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install Flask
```bash
pip install Flask
```
Create a Simple Flask API
```bash
sudo vi app.py
```
```bash
// Add this to app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
	return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()
```
Verify if it works by running 
```bash
python app.py
```
Run Gunicorn WSGI server to serve the Flask Application
When you “run” flask, you are actually running Werkzeug’s development WSGI server, which forward requests from a web server.
Since Werkzeug is only for development, we have to use Gunicorn, which is a production-ready WSGI server, to serve our application.

Install Gunicorn using the below command:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```
Run Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app 
```
Gunicorn is running (Ctrl + C to exit gunicorn)!
